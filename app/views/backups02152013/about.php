	<h1>Some ideas aren't about the bottom line.</h1><br>

<div class='lead'><p>Some ideas are about making the world a better place, about providing people with the tools and services they need to empower themselves, to improve their lives. These are the ideas that truly change the world.</p>

<p><b>Openfire</b>'s job is to connect the people who can turn these ideas into reality: visionaries, financial backers, collaborators, mentors, evangelists.</p>
