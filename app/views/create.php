	<p><b>It happens to every creative person.</b> You've got skills, knowledge and talent that feel like they're going to waste. You sit and stare at the upholstered wall of your cubicle, wishing you could just devote yourself to that dream project, the one that could make the world a better place...if you had the time and the money.</p>
	<p style='font-size: 1.5em; text-align:center'>What if you did?</p>
	<p>That's what <b>openfire</b> is for. We help you raise money for each of the steps of your project, assemble your own team of badass ninjas to get stuff done, and reach out to people who are willing to pitch in to see your vision realized.</p>

	<p>Whether you need cash for R&D, travel, or just to keep the power on while you lock yourself away writing code, we can help you put it together. And just as importantly, we can help you find people who believe in your project as much as you do.</p>

	<p>Quit staring at that cubicle wall. It's not going to go away until you're ready to make a change.</p>
