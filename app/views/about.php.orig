<b>Touring is an essential right of passage for bands aspiring to stardom.</b> But touring means leavin behind their most ardent local fans in the quest to spread their sound around the country. For even the most talented bands, it's a major uphill battle to build a geographically-diverse fan base, and find ways to monetize their efforts on tour to reach (or stay) in the black along the way.
</p>
<p>
In short, touring is usually a lot like playing a  modern version of Oregon Trail when everything goes to hell in a hand-basket: tiny food budgets, questionable lodging, wagon breakdowns, and much, much more.
</p>

	<p style='font-size: 1.5em; text-align:center'>That's where BandAid comes in.</p>

<p>We wanted to give bands a fighting chance against the harsh realities of touring. Musicians use <strong>BandAid</strong> so fans at home can support them while they're on the road" and cut the comma after road
</p>
<p>
In short, we help fans feed the band.
</p>
<p>
No other funding platform provides customized ways for touring bands to keep in touch with fans and support themselves while on the road. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>BandAid</strong> was created by an 8-member boy band at Las Vegas StartupWeekend #6.
